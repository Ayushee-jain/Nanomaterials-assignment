**Question 1:** 
To deduce the total number of atoms and surface atoms for the different shells of cuboctahedral/spherical shape. Plot % of atoms in bulk/surface versus particle size. The user should get the idea to generate the thickness or size of nanoparticle for a particular application (optical/electrical/magnetic/strength)
